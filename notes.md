* material-ui
* react-pro-router
* react-pro-sidebar
* formik - Formik makes form validation easy! When paired with Yup, they abstract all the complexities that surround handling forms in React. With that we can then go ahead to create the schema weâ€™ll be using for the sign in form using Yup.
* yup - 
* fullcalendar - calendar integration
* nivo charts - programtic import for data charts

## Dependency install script
`npm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/x-data-grid @mui/icons-material react-router-dom@6 react-pro-sidebar@0.7.1 formik yup @fullcalendar/core @fullcalendar/daygrid @fullcalendar/timegrid @fullcalendar/list @nivo/core @nivo/pie @nivo/line @nivo/bar @nivo/geo`

**Note: When you want to edit multiple of the same string value - you can highlight the first value and hit command + d to select multiple of the same value and edit at the same time

**Note: With the help of Tailwind-shades we can highlight one of the main colors of our pallet and create a gradient by hitting cmd + k, cmd + g - this creates a list of shades for that color 1 - 9 (100-900)

**Note: to sort lines you can highlight them, hit cmd + p, type >, then search sort lines: ascending/descending - like we did in the theme.js with the color shades

* NOTE: make sure you are cd into the client: "dash-client"
